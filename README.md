# Air Quality Improvement During COVID-19 Manila Lockdown Visualization Using PowerPoint
This visualization was the result of a challenge to create a data visualization from any publicly available COVID-19-related data without using tool commonly used in creating data visualizations such as Tableau, PowerBI, Excel, Python, etc.

The topic was inspired by a special report on air quality beyond COVID-19 by Greenpeace and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) from June 2020 (link: https://www.greenpeace.org/philippines/publication/9753/special-report-managing-air-quality-beyond-covid-19/). The figures in the visualization were obtained from the 2018-2022 ranking of the world's most polluted countries by IQAir (link: https://www.iqair.com/ca/world-most-polluted-countries)

The visualization was created using only Microsoft PowerPoint. The background was a composite of 2 images, cited below. No other resoures outside PowerPoint were used.
